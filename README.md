NBA is a very popular sport here in North America and the most recognized players get paid a good amount of salary if their stats are good. The player stats include his turnover rate, points scored, fouls committed, assists etc. during the game. If we are working as an analyst in the management department and we want to predict their salaries to estimate the salary cap we need to understand the dynamics of their performance and conclude the results. The managers are always on the hot spot when it comes to determine the player to be retained and the salary cap to be drafted as that changes the fate of the team and increases its chances of winning the championship. In this case study we were focused on creating a regression model to predict the salary cap for the players. Correlation is also a major metric we considered in this case to identify the relation between dependent variables and independent variables. The predicted salary is not always accurate as there are certain outliers every time which alter the other way. So, we can check the accuracy by taking these into consideration.
